ðŸ“Š Avocado EDA Project
This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of avocado sales using Python and Pandas. It demonstrates various data operations including reading CSVs, handling missing values, applying groupby functions, and performing statistical aggregations. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib to uncover trends and insights across regions, time, and avocado types. The notebook also includes examples of filtering, indexing, and calculating custom quantiles. Ideal for beginners learning data manipulation and EDA, this project presents a structured and practical approach to working with real-world data in Jupyter Notebooks.
